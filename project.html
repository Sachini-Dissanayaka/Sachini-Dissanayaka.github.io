                                Final Year Project</h3>
                            <p>Technologies - Deep Learning, PyTorch, Python, GCP</p>
                            <p>This was based on implementation of the state-of-the-art model for 2 speaker overlapping
                                speech diarization by reducing the Diarization Error Rate (DER). We proposed three more
                                models by improving the current state-of-the-art Self Attention
                                model, which are combinations of Local Dense Synthesizer-Attention layer with Self
                                Attention, Relative Attention and External Attention layers.</p>

                            <p>Technologies - Python, Flask, React.js, BeautifulSoup, Elasticsearch, Kibana</p>
                            <p>This is an information retrieval system that can be used to query and get any type of
                                data about Sinhala Politicians. The dataset of the project was scrapped using
                                BeautifulSoup and the project was implemented using Python, React.js, and supported by a
                                python-Flask powered backend. I have used Elasticsearch for indexing and quering. </p>

                            <p>Python solution for Pump-It-Up, DrivenData machine learning competition. I have used
                                various kinds of encoding, normalization techniques and learned pre-processing and
                                post-processing techniques as well. I was within 4% of the global participant results in
                                this competition. The result was great because it had been 0.8234, compared with the
                                first place 0.8294.</p>

                            <p>This group project is about creating a distributed chat application. The system consists
                                of two main distributed components: chat servers and chat clients, which can run on
                                different hosts. I have implemented all the functions for one server
                                (createroom,joinroom,etc.) and implemented the Heartbeat algorithm using gossiping and
                                consensus for failure detection.</p>

                            <p>Implemented an "Online tour planning platform" that can be used to plan a tour. The user
                                can find the most attractive places, nearest places and hotels around the city as well.
                                The mobile application frontend was implemented by me using Flutter framework.</p>
